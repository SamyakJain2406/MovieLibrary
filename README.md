# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests] for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment] for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation].

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

This project is a movie library web application built with React.js. It allows users to:

View a list of movies from a data source (local or external API)
Optionally search for specific movies (if API integration is implemented)
Potentially add, edit, or delete movies from their library (depending on your desired functionality)
Getting Started

Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://your-github-repository.com/your-username/movie-library-react.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(Replace the placeholder URL with your actual repository URL)
Install Dependencies:
Bash
cd movie-library-react
npm install
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(or yarn install if you prefer yarn)
Running the Application

Start the development server:
Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(or yarn start) This will launch the application in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:3000/

Features (to be customized based on your implementation)

Movie List: Displays a list of movies from the data source.
Search (Optional): Allows users to filter movies based on keywords, genres, etc. (if using an API)
Movie Details (Optional): Provides more information about a selected movie (if applicable)
CRUD Operations (Optional): Enables adding, editing, and deleting movies from the user's library (requires a persistent data storage solution)
Data Source

Initially, you can start with a local data source (e.g., an array of objects) in your app code.
For a more dynamic experience, consider integrating an external movie API like TMDb ([invalid URL removed]). This requires obtaining an API key and implementing API calls in your utils/api.js file.
Deployment

For production deployment, build the application for a static web server using:
Bash
npm run build
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(or yarn build) This will create an out directory containing optimized production-ready files.
Customization

Feel free to customize the styling, components, and functionalities to match your preferences.
Consider using React Router for more complex routing needs (e.g., separate pages for movie details).
Explore local storage or a backend database for persistence if you want to allow user-specific libraries.
